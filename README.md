This repo contains my trials of random forest and Multi-Layer perceptron (yet to come)

## Random Forest Classifier 
Using data from the HAR Dataset provided by UC Irvine's Machine learning repository. 
Using hyperparameter tuning, I increased the accuracy of classifying moves from 91.958% to 93.994%

Checked the importance of the 500+ features in the dataset and visualised it to remove noise and raise accuracy to 94.164%

## Multi-layer perceptron

Using data from HAR Dataset provided by UC Irvine's Machine learning repositiory. The accuracy of the current model is 98% on average.
